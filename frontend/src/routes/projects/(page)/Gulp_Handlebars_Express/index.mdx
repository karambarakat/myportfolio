The "Gulp-Handlebars-Express" project is a toy application that showcases the use of fundamental web technologies to create a simple yet functional web application. This project leverages three core components: Gulp, Handlebars, and Express, to demonstrate how these tools can work together harmoniously.

Gulp is used as the build system to automate various tasks such as compiling stylesheets, bundling JavaScript, and optimizing assets. This streamlines the development process and ensures that the application's resources are optimized for production.

Handlebars, a lightweight templating engine, is employed for rendering dynamic content. It allows for the creation of reusable templates and simplifies the process of displaying data on the web pages. This ensures a clean and maintainable separation of the application's logic and presentation.

Express, a popular Node.js web application framework, serves as the backend for the project. It handles routing, API endpoints, and other server-related tasks. This creates a full-stack application where Gulp takes care of the front-end, while Express manages the server-side functionality.

Overall, "Gulp-Handlebars-Express" is a basic web application that illustrates the synergy between these technologies, making it an excellent starting point for those looking to understand the foundations of web development.
