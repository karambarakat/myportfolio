This is a private local-first progressive web app that I built to manage my todos and notes. It is built using [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) and [SQL.js]

## Features

- SQLite: data is stored locally in the browser using sqlite database.
- Qwik: Qwik frontend framework.
- OPFS: Origin-Private-File-System to make offline experience, and enable downloading and uploading the data to local file.

comming
- Syncing via the cloud
